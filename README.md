## Threading 
(~Detailed https://github.com/MaclaurinYudhisthira/Python-concurrency/tree/main/Multiprocessing#multiprocessing~)
1. Multithreading (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture))
2. Thread (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing))
3. Thread pool, thread pool executor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_(computer_science))
4. Daemon thread (https://superfastpython.com/daemon-threads-in-python/)
4. Timer Thread (sync premitive for threading)

## Multiprocessing 
(Detailed https://github.com/MaclaurinYudhisthira/Python-concurrency/tree/main/Threading#threading)
1. Process
2. Thread vs Process (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)
3. Daemon Process (https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=processes-)4
4. Fork & spawn (https://superfastpython.com/fork-faster-than-spawn/)
